## Project 1
### Objective

- Implement Random Forests using sklearn in Python
- Implement h2o deep learning estimator in python to generate important deep learning features .

H2O is an open source, in-memory, distributed, fast, and scalable machine learning and predictive analytics platform that allows you to build machine learning models on big data and provides easy productionalization of those models in an enterprise environment. https://www.h2o.ai/ I used the availability of h2O in python.

Deep Learning using Autoencoders and GLM algorithms using H2o platform

*i. GLM_h2o.R shows the implementation of Rigde and Lasso regression using the h2o platform in R.The code shows the approach to grid search*

*ii. RandomForest_DeepLearning_in_Python shows the implementation of Random forest algorithm and Deep learning using h2o in python*

*iii. DeepLearning :implementation of Random forest algorithm and Deep learning in R.The code shows the generation of deep learning features which are further used to build random forest model on the data set*
